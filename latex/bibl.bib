  abstract = {The Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project is a collaborative effort providing broad-coverage instantiated normalized morphological inflection tables for hundreds of diverse world languages. The project comprises two major thrusts: a language-independent feature schema for rich morphological annotation and a type-level resource of annotated data in diverse languages realizing that schema. This paper presents the expansions and improvements made on several fronts over the last couple of years (since McCarthy et al. (2020)). Collaborative efforts by numerous linguists have added 67 new languages, including 30 endangered languages. We have implemented several improvements to the extraction pipeline to tackle some issues, e.g. missing gender and macron information. We have also amended the schema to use a hierarchical structure that is needed for morphological phenomena like multiple-argument agreement and case stacking, while adding some missing morphological features to make the schema more inclusive. In light of the last UniMorph release, we also augmented the database with morpheme segmentation for 16 languages. Lastly, this new release makes a push towards inclusion of derivational morphology in UniMorph by enriching the data and annotation schema with instances representing derivational processes from MorphyNet.},

  abstract = {The aspectual opposition in Polish is encoded morphologically at the verb level. However, it is not immediately evident, whether by word-formation or inflectional means. Aspect marking is obligatory but semantically non-uniform and formally irregular. Traditionally, prefixed formations (e.g. "pisać" 'write, imperf.' – "na-pisać" 'write, perf.') have been regarded as products of word-formation, whereas suffixed forms (e.g. "kup-i•ć" 'buy, perf.' – "kup-owa•ć" 'buy, imperf.') as products of inflection. More recent approaches attempt to tip the scales in favour of a uniform process. The Polish data are analysed in an inferential-realisational Lexeme Morpheme Base Morphology framework. It is argued that the semantic information pertaining to event structure [±dynamic, ±durative, ±Consequent State] can be made available to syntax thanks to the mediation of the features [±Imperfective, ±Perfective] in the morpho-lexical representation of the verbal stem. At the point of lexical insertion, verb stems are already endowed with an abstractly specified value as perfective or imperfective and aspect information is lexically encoded as part of verb class specification. Consequently, the processes which alter aspect values are in the domain of the lexicon too.},

Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character \$n\$-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character \$n\$-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

We then propose an operational definition of contrasts between words as offset vectors in a distributional vector space of the kind familiar from distributional semantics. In the empirical part of the paper, we show that French data does validate the hypothesis for all pairings of an inflectional and a derivational relation that we were able to investigate.},

Are there word formation processes that can be or should be accounted for by independently motivated syntactic rules, or is all word formation to be accounted for by a separate morphological component? A second important issue is that of the relation between word formation and inflection. Word formation seems to be more of a lexical nature, whereas inflection has a syntactic flavour. So the question is whether inflection should be seen as part of the pre-syntactic morphological component, or as belonging to a separate post-syntactic component of inflection, in which the morphosyntactic features of words are spelled out.},

It discusses the basic and uncontroversial characteristics of inflexion, derivation, and compounding with data from Romance languages and presents specific topics and case studies that challenge the traditional view from both a synchronic and a diachronic perspective. The first case study considers the ways in which various morphophonological alternations, such as diphthongization and palatalization, pattern alike or differently with respect to inflexion, derivation, and compounding. The question whether inflexion and derivation can be distinguished on semantic grounds is the focus of two further case studies dealing with (i) the formal marking and the semantic interpretation of number in Italian ambigeneric nouns, and (ii) with the different outcomes of the Latin augment /-sc-/ in modern Romance languages, which evolved in some languages into an inflexional marker, while retaining a derivational function in others. A final topic covered is so-called ‘conversion’, defined here as a transpositional (i.e., category-changing) process that is not marked by any formative, and thus applies to fully inflected words.},

A common approach relies on qualitative differences in the semantic relationship between inflectionally versus derivationally related words: inflection yields ways to discuss the same concept in different syntactic contexts, while derivation gives rise to words for related concepts. This differential can be expected to manifest in the predictability of word frequency between words that are related derivationally or inflectionally: predicting the token frequency of a word based on information about its base form or about related words should be easier when the two words are in an inflectional relationship, rather than a derivational one. We compare prediction error magnitude for statistical models of token frequency based on distributional and frequency information of inflectionally or derivationally related words in French. The results conform to expectations: it is easier to predict the frequency of a word from properties of an inflectionally related word than from those of a derivationally related word. Prediction error provides a quantitative, continuous method to explore differences between individual processes and differences yielded by employing different predicting information, which in turn can be used to draw conclusions about the nature and manifestation of the inflection–derivation distinction.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

Despite its ubiquity, its underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. This study explores the effect of different proxies of context confusability, specifically cosine similarity and symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence, through a cross-linguistic analysis using contextualized embeddings for English and Spanish data. By analyzing the distribution of raw data and fitting various logistic regression models, we examined the behavior of these measures in the context of colexification and tested their predictive capacity. Our findings are consistent across both English and Spanish, with slight variations between them. Both predictors were found to hold information for the prediction of colexification, effectively working as proxies of contextual confusability through all sets of contextualized embeddings. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the circumstances under which colexification occurs, offering new insights into the factors influencing this linguistic phenomenon.},

  abstract = {In morphology, a distinction is commonly drawn between inflection and derivation. However, a precise definition of this distinction which reflects the way it manifests across languages remains elusive within linguistic theory, typically being based on subjective tests. In this study, we present 4 quantitative measures which use the statistics of a raw text corpus in a language to estimate to what extent a given morphological construction changes the form and distribution of lexemes. In particular, we measure both the average and the variance of this change across lexemes. Crucially, distributional information captures syntactic and semantic properties and can be operationalised by word embeddings. Based on a sample of 26 languages, we find that we can reconstruct 89±1\% of the classification of constructions into inflection and derivation in UniMorph using our 4 measures, providing large-scale cross-linguistic evidence that the concepts of inflection and derivation are associated with measurable signatures in terms of form and distribution that behave consistently across a variety of languages. We also use our measures to identify in a quantitative way whether categories of inflection which have been considered noncanonical in the linguistic literature, such as inherent inflection or transpositions, appear so in terms of properties of their form and distribution. We find that while combining multiple measures reduces the amount of overlap between inflectional and derivational constructions, there are still many constructions near the model’s decision boundary between the two categories. This indicates a gradient, rather than categorical, distinction.},

Assuming no knowledge of the field of morphology on the part of the reader, the book presents a broad range of morphological phenomena from a wide variety of languages. Starting with the core areas of inflection and derivation, the book presents the interfaces between morphology and syntax and between morphology and phonology. The synchronic study of word structure is covered, as are the phenomena of diachronic change, such as analogy and grammaticalization. Theories are presented clearly in accessible language with the main purpose of shedding light on the data, rather than as a goal in themselves. The authors consistently draw on the best research available, thus utilizing and discussing both functionalist and generative theoretical approaches. Each chapter includes a summary, suggestions for further reading, and exercises.~ As such this is the ideal book for both beginning students of linguistics, or anyone in a related discipline looking for a first introduction to morphology.},

This tradition has led to rather different terminological treatments of the two kinds of patterns, but from the perspective of a constructional view of morphology, there is no need to incorporate such differences into formal grammatical descriptions. For practical purposes, we need clear and simple definitions of entrenched terms of general linguistics, so the article proposes semantically based (retro-) definitions of inflection , derivation and lexeme that cover the bulk of the existing usage. Finally, I briefly explain why we need sharp definitions of comparative concepts, and why prototype-based and fuzzy definitions of traditional terms are not helpful.},

  abstract = {AbstractThis study contributes to a longstanding discussion on the status of aspectual morphology and the aspectual architecture in Slavic by investigating aspectual properties of perfective and imperfective VP idioms in Polish. The investigation reveals that only lexical prefixes which can result in idiosyncratic meanings are part of basic perfective VP idioms. Building on the idea that littlevis a demarcation line for idiomatic meanings, it is concluded that lexical prefixes arevP-internal. It is also shown that basic imperfective VP idioms are compatible with some superlexical prefixes and basic perfective VP idioms are compatible with secondary imperfective morphology, which suggests that such morphology isvP-external. Further semantic analysis of the interaction of basic imperfective VP idioms with different classes of superlexical prefixes shows that the compatible ones measure over some scale associated withvP-external material or the temporal trace of an (idiomatic) event. In contrast, the incompatible ones measure over a scale encoded by a verbal predicate or impose semantic restrictions on its argument and hence they intervene in the semantics of a VP idiom. Based on stacking facts and the interaction of different classes of superlexical prefixes with secondary imperfective morphology, two classes of superlexical prefixes are distinguished:high(projected above secondary imperfective) andlow(projected below it). These observations are compatible with the view that aspectual morphology is separated from PFV and IPFV operators. The former may merge lower in the hierarchy, and the latter act at the level of AspP as phonologically null operators.},

  abstract = {The term word-and-paradigm grammar (Hockett, 1954; Robins, 1959) may be used of any grammar which preserves the traditional distinction between morphology and syntax. This distinction is usually drawn as follows. Following the classical formulation (Dionysius Thrax in Uhlig, 1883:22, line 4; Priscian in Keil, 1855: 53, line 8), any sentence is said to have as its minimal elements a set of [grammatical] words. Such words are of two main types. Some are invariable: examples are the Latin conjunctions et and atque or the prepositions per and in. Others, for example the verb amo or the noun dominus, are variable: they appear in a variety of forms (amo, amabas, amatus, ….; dominus, domino, dominorum, ….) with different syntactic properties. The ‘function’ and distribution of these variants, in relation to each other and to the invariables, is handled by the syntactic sections of the grammar; their phonological or graphological ‘shape’, on the other hand, is stated by the morphology. It is, for instance, a syntactic rule which states that the preposition per must govern a noun in the ACC [usative]2 case, but it is a subject of morphology that dominum, terram, etc. are ACC forms of their respective nouns. The field of grammar, as opposed to phonology, semantics, etc., is thus divided into two separate but interconnected sub-fields: one dealing with what may be called the ‘external’, the other with the ‘internal’ characteristics of grammatical words.},

As in the first edition, the theoretical discussion is eclectic and critical: its scope ranges from the ancient grammarians to the work of Chomsky and his followers, the disintegration of the classical Chomskyan scheme, and the renewed standing of morphology and historical linguistics in recent years. The examples are drawn from English and other European languages, both ancient and modern.

Lexicographic resources (e.g., WordNet) capture only some of this context-dependent variation; for example, they often do not encode how closely senses, or discretized word meanings, are related to one another. Our work investigates whether recent advances in NLP, specifically contextualized word embeddings, capture human-like distinctions between English word senses, such as polysemy and homonymy. We collect data from a behavioral, web-based experiment, in which participants provide judgments of the relatedness of multiple WordNet senses of a word in a two-dimensional spatial arrangement task. We find that participants' judgments of the relatedness between senses are correlated with distances between senses in the BERT embedding space. Specifically, homonymous senses (e.g., bat as mammal vs. bat as sports equipment) are reliably more distant from one another in the embedding space than polysemous ones (e.g., chicken as animal vs. chicken as meat). Our findings point towards the potential utility of continuous-space representations of sense meanings.},

  abstract = {Transformer-based models have pushed state of the art in many areas of NLP, but our understanding of what is behind their success is still limited. This paper is the first survey of over 150 studies of the popular BERT model. We review the current state of knowledge about how BERT works, what kind of information it learns and how it is represented, common modifications to its training objectives and architecture, the overparameterization issue and approaches to compression. We then outline directions for future research.},

  abstract = {We investigate to what extent inflection can be automatically separated from derivation, just based on the word forms. We expect pairs of inflected forms of the same lemma to be closer to each other than pairs of inflected forms of two different lemmas (still derived from a same root, though), given a proper distance measure. We estimate distances of word forms using edit distance, which represents character-based similarity, and word embedding similarity, which serves as a proxy to meaning similarity. Specifically, we explore Levenshtein and Jaro-Winkler edit distances, and cosine similarity of FastText word embeddings. We evaluate the separability of inflection and derivation on a sample from DeriNet, a database of word formation relations in Czech. We investigate the word distance measures directly, as well as embedded in a clustering setup. Best results are achieved by using a combination of Jaro-Winkler edit distance and word embedding cosine similarity, outperforming each of the individual measures. Further analysis shows that the method works better for some classes of inflections and derivations than for others, revealing some limitations of the method, but also supporting the idea of replacing a binary inflection-derivation dichotomy with a continous scale.},

  abstract = {A new contribution to linguistic theory, this book presents a formal framework for the analysis of word structure in human language. It sets forth the network of hypotheses constituting Paradigm Function Morphology, a theory of inflectional form whose central insight is that paradigms play an essential role in the definition of a language's system of word structure. The theory comprises several unprecedented claims, chief among which is the claim that a language's realization rules serve as clauses in the definition of a paradigm function, an overarching construct which is indispensable for capturing certain kinds of generalizations about inflectional form. This book differs from other recent works on the same subject in that it treats inflectional morphology as an autonomous system of principles rather than as a subsystem of syntax or phonology and it draws upon evidence from a diverse range of languages in motivating the proposed conception of word structure.},

  abstract = {The notion of inflection rests on the more basic notion of lexeme. A lexeme is a unit of linguistic analysis which belongs to a particular syntactic category, has a particular meaning or grammatical function, and ordinarily enters into syntactic combinations as a single word; in many instances, the identity of the word which realizes a particular lexeme varies systematically according to the syntactic context in which it is to be used. Thus, English has a verbal lexeme meaning ‘cantāre’ which enters into syntactic combinations as either sing, sings, sang, sung, or singing, depending on its syntactic context; this lexeme might be given the arbitrary label sing. The words realizing a given lexeme can be conceived of both as units of form (i.e. as phonological words, such as /sæŋ/) and as units of grammatical analysis (i.e. as grammatical words, such as ‘the past tense of sing’); the full set of words realizing a particular lexeme constitutes its paradigm.},

  abstract = {We use the notation of semantic feature structures as a formalised metalanguage for describing aspectual meanings in various languages regardless of the linguistic level (morphological, syntactical, lexical etc). We propose to describe the Aspect category as a pair of feature bundles : Analysis and Control. The Analysis of a situation (viewed as a whole or as one of its moments or stages) is considered as its endocentric aspect, and the Control of a situation (viewed as a set of operations such as iteration, flow and intensity modifications, composition) is defined as its exocentric aspect because it is imposed from outside. These aspectual features occur and combine diversely depending on the semantic type of the situation to which a verb is related (due to hyperonymy/hyponymy lattice). On the other hand, during nearly all the 20 th century, Slavonic theories of aspect were dominated by the distinction between Aspect and Aktionsart, and this distinction was extended to other languages. Our cognitive approach makes it possible to bring closer the two categories and to define the perfective aspect in Slavonic languages as a hypercategory including Aspect and Aktionsart leaving the traditional distinction for more detailed discussion.},
